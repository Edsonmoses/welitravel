                <div class="content-title"> <span><i class="active-icon"></i>What is Umrah?</span></div>
                <div class="content">Umrah is a pilgrimage to Mecca perfomed by Muslims around the world. Umrah can be undertaken at any time of the year, unlike Hajj.</div>
                <div class="content-title"> <span><i class="active-icon"></i>What is Hajj? What is its significance?</span></div>
                <div class="content">Hajj is a religious duty for Muslims, one that must be performed at least once in the life of every Muslim who is able to complete it. A reflection of the solidarity and unity of the Muslim Ummah, Hajj is the largest, most impressive spiritual pilgrimage in history. When one performs Hajj—assuming they do so correctly—the Prophet said they will return from Hajj without sin and purified. </div>
                <div class="content-title"> <span><i class="active-icon"></i>Do all Muslims have to perform Hajj?</span></div>
                <div class="content">Yes. However, there are certain factors to take into consideration. First, only Muslim adults (whether male or female) are required to perform Hajj. This means that, while children may go to Hajj, it is not required of them. Maturity and an ability to understand the magnitude of the pilgrimage are needed to fully take advantage of the experience. A sound mind and full control of one’s mental capacities are required to perform Hajj.</div>
                <div class="content-title"> <span><i class="active-icon"></i>How much preparation is needed before I go on my Hajj trip?</span></div>
                <div class="content">As much as possible! Most people spend at least a month before any normal trip just preparing, shopping, planning, etc. Hajj is the most important trip you will ever go on throughout your life. Extensive planning is highly recommended. We suggest, you leave this for Weli Travel to worry on your behalf. </div>
                <div class="content-title"> <span><i class="active-icon"></i>What do Muslims at Hajj wear?</span></div>
                <div class="content">Men wear the Ihram, two unstitched white cloths. Women can wear whatever they usually wear in prayer, so long as it is Islamically appropriate.</div>
                <div class="content-title"> <span><i class="active-icon"></i>What are the Hajj rituals?</span></div>
                <div class="content">There are too many to get into detail here. But we have that covered before your Life-Changing journey. These range from the Obligation of hajj, Prohibitions and many more.</div>
